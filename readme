Bank Transaction Emulator and Quality Checker

Hey there! Welcome to this GitHub repository. Here's a quick rundown of what you'll find here.
What's in this repo?

We have two key pieces of code here:

    Bank Transaction Emulator: This is a Python script that makes up fake (or "emulated") bank transactions. Each transaction has stuff like a unique transaction ID, an account ID, what type of transaction it was (like a deposit or withdrawal), how much the transaction was for, and when the transaction happened.

    Data Quality Checker: This script gives the data in the database a quick health check. It looks at things like how many rows of data there are, if there are any missing values or duplicate rows, if the data types look right, and whether there are any transaction types that don't make sense.

How do I use this?

Here's a step-by-step guide:

Step 1: Make sure you've got Python installed and you've also installed the packages psycopg2 and pandas. You can do this by typing in pip install psycopg2 pandas into your terminal.

Step 2: Fill in your PostgreSQL database details in the config.py file.

Step 3: Run the bank transaction emulator script by typing python emulator.py into your terminal. This script will create a table in your PostgreSQL database (if it doesn't already exist) and will start filling it with fake transactions.

Step 4: Check the data by running the data quality checker script. You can do this by typing python checker.py into your terminal. This script will run some checks on the data and write the results into a file.

That's it!
